1) I used the formulas given by the professor.
2) I used Structs that contained arrays of page_table_entries.
3) I believe so.
4) Yes
5) FIFO strategy thus the tlb entry that was inserted first

1) It is general for the FIFO to LRU. For the file names it is not generals
2)Just change the TLB marco
3)Yes
4)No since the virtual address's are matched one to one. Entering a duplicate virtual address
should result in a duplicate physical address.

1)I would like to believe so. I followed all code writing instructions.
2)No not really I followed all resources carefully
3)Yes for makefiles as shown below.


For the makefile I kept getting an error stating that "I had an undefined reference to `welcomeMessage()'"
When I went online and copied the sample code makefile at http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/
it also didn't work stating the same error. As such I have inlcuded the make file but unless you uncomment line
6 it won't do anything.
