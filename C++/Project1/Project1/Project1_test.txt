For the above situation entering anything (even strings!) will cause the program to output a warning and then ask for the user to reenter their choice. Entering 1-5 will allow the program to function as usual. If the user enters a valid response and then a space or illegal character anything after the valid input should be ignored.(eg entering 1 should give the same result as 1 1 1 1 1).
